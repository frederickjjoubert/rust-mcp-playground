# Rust MCP Playground

This repository is for me to experiment with the Model Context Protocol, specifically for Rust implementations of Clients and Servers.

I'm going to try to leverage <https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk> which seems to be the current state of the art and most supports and community driven Rust MCP SDK.

We may want to also look to <https://github.com/AdamStrojek/rust-agentai> for use by or to power our client.
